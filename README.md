# Led_Blink_App

In this project, I made a 4-state led application with using PIC16F84A microcontroller. Requirements for this project are described below:

## Requirements

1) PIC16F84A Microcontroller
2) 2 22pF capacitor
3) 4 MHz Crystal
4) 2 Switches
5) 8 LED's
6) 10k Resistor
7) Jumper Cables

I used a Arduino Uno for the supply voltage. I set a digital pin of Arduino, logic-1 and supplied my logic circuit. I also set first 2 registers of PORTA as input pins, whole registers of PORTB as output pins to the LED's. I used MPLAB X IDE for C coding, PicKit3 and MPLAP IPE for the programming the microcontroller. I also used Crystal and capacitors for the oscillator circuit.
